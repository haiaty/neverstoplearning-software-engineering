**Basic Concept**

The Sidecar Pattern is a pattern used mostly in microservices architecture to provide a way to offload or add functionality to a service (think of it like a nodejs/python/java app) without adding to the complexity of the service itself. 

It involves deploying a helper service, known as a "sidecar," alongside your main service. 

This sidecar runs in the same network space as your service, meaning it can easily communicate with the main service, intercept or proxy network traffic, and even share the same lifecycle as the main service. 

Essentially, it's like having a co-pilot for your application that can handle auxiliary tasks such as monitoring, logging, configuration updates, security-related tasks (like SSL/TLS termination), and more.

Let's imagine our Node.js application is like a clubhouse where you and your friends have lots of fun activities. But, there's a problem: you want to make sure that only your friends can come in, and you also want to remember all the fun things you do every day.

So, we use something called a "sidecar," which is like a friendly helper robot that stays next to your clubhouse.

For the authorization part: Before anyone can enter your clubhouse, they have to tell a secret password to the robot. If they know the right password, the robot lets them in. This way, only your friends who know the secret password can join the fun.

For the logging part: Every time someone comes in or does something fun inside, the robot writes it down in its big notebook. This is like keeping a diary of all the fun things you and your friends do, so you can remember them later.

In our computer world, the clubhouse is your Node.js application where all the main activities happen. The robot helper is the sidecar service that checks if people have the right password to use your application (that's the authorization part) and writes down everything that happens (that's the logging part).

And just like in our story, the robot (sidecar) and the clubhouse (Node.js application) are best friends and work together to make sure everything runs smoothly and safely!


## PRATICAL APPLICATION (with docker compose)

Creating a practical example involving a Node.js application with a sidecar for authorization and logging using Docker Compose involves setting up two main components:

_Node.js_ Application: The primary service that handles business logic.
_Sidecar Service_: A secondary service that handles both authorization (validating requests before they reach the main application) and logging (capturing logs from the main application and potentially from the authorization process).
For this example, let's assume:

The Node.js application provides a simple REST API.
The sidecar service uses a lightweight HTTP server (e.g., based on Node.js or Python with Flask) to intercept requests for authorization and uses a logging mechanism (like Winston for Node.js) to log requests and their outcomes.

```bash

## DOCKER COMPOSE SETUP
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - sidecar
  sidecar:
    build: ./sidecar
    volumes:
      - ./sidecar:/usr/src/sidecar
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"

```

Node.js Application (app)
Dockerfile (in ./app/Dockerfile):
```bash
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

server.js:

```bash
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from the main application!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Sidecar Service (sidecar)
For the sidecar, you'd need a simple server that can handle authorization and logging. This example will be simplistic and focus more on structure rather than a full implementation.

Dockerfile (in ./sidecar/Dockerfile):

```bash
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/sidecar
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["node", "sidecar.js"]

```

sidecar.js:
```bash
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

app.use(express.json());

app.all('*', async (req, res) => {
  console.log(`Received request for ${req.method} ${req.path}`);

  // Simple Authorization Mockup
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    console.log('Unauthorized request');
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  console.log('Request authorized, forwarding to main application');

  // Forward the request to the main application
  // Adjust the port and path as necessary
  try {
    const response = await axios({
      method: req.method,
      url: `http://app:3000${req.path}`,
      data: req.body,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    });

    // Forward the response from the main application back to the client
    res.send(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error forwarding request:', error.message);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Sidecar running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Notes

Authorization: This sidecar example uses a very basic check for an authorization header. In a real-world scenario, you'd replace this with actual logic to validate tokens or API keys.

Logging: Logging is done simply via console.log. For production, you'd likely use a more robust solution like Winston or Bunyan in Node.js, and forward logs to a central logging service or database.
Request Forwarding: The sidecar intercepts all requests and forwards them to the main application after authorization. Adjust the forwarding URL as necessary based on your setup.

Remember, this example focuses on the conceptual setup. Depending on your actual requirements, the implementation details, especially around security and logging, would need to be more comprehensive.


## WHEN TO USE ##

The Sidecar pattern and service mesh are methods to easily apply common features, like logging, security, or monitoring, across a network of computers. They're useful for more than just linking operations together. For example, instead of adding security checks to each service individually, you can use a service mesh to handle security for all services at once. This approach works like the Decorator Design Pattern from a famous design book, letting someone add extra functions, such as adding a logging feature that tracks all messages between services, across a network without changing how things are normally connected.
