docker run --name static-site -e AUTHOR="Your Name" -d -P dockersamples/static-site

In the above command:

-d will create a container with the process detached from our terminal
-P will publish all the exposed container ports to random ports on the Docker host
-e is how you pass environment variables to the container
--name allows you to specify a container name
AUTHOR is the environment variable name and Your Name is the value that you can pass
