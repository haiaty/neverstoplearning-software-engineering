When deciding whether to use SQL, R, or Python for an analysis, consider:

Where is the data located—in a database, a file, a website?

What is the volume of data?

Where is the data going—into a report, a visualization, a statistical analysis?

Will it need to be updated or refreshed with new data? How often?

What does your team or organization use, and how important is it to conform to existing standards?
