Messages are queued asynchronously between client applications and messaging system. Two types of messaging patterns are available âˆ’ one is point to point and the other is publish-subscribe (pub-sub)

## Point to Point Messaging System

In a point-to-point system, messages are persisted in a queue. One or more consumers can consume the messages in the queue, but a particular message can be consumed by a maximum of one consumer only. Once a consumer reads a message in the queue, it disappears from that queue.

## Publish-Subscribe Messaging System
