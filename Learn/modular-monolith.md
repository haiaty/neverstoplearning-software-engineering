### WHAT IS MODULAR MONOLITH?
A Modulith, or Modular Monolith, is an architectural style that organizes a monolithic application into well-defined, loosely coupled modules. Each module is focused on a specific area of functionality and can be developed, tested, and deployed relatively independently within the same application. The idea is to combine the simplicity and straightforwardness of a monolithic architecture with some of the modularity and maintainability benefits of microservices.

Simple Explanation:
Imagine you're building a house (your application). In a traditional monolith, you might have one big blueprint (codebase) where changes in the kitchen can affect the bedroom because everything is interconnected. In a microservices architecture, each room of the house is a separate mini-house (service) with its own blueprint, which is great for making changes to one room without affecting the others but can be complex to manage.

A Modulith is like having a single house where each room (module) has its own mini-blueprint. You can work on the kitchen without worrying too much about the bedroom because each room is well-defined and somewhat independent, but it's still all part of one big house. You don't have to go outside (network) to get from one room to another, but you still know where one room ends, and another begins.

### Simple Example:
Let's say you're building an e-commerce application. In a Modular Monolith architecture, you might divide your application into several modules like:

User Management Module:

Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
Independent from product browsing but can interact with it when, for example, a user wants to view their order history.


Product Catalog Module:

Manages product listings, categories, and search functionality.
Operates independently of the order processing but provides the necessary information to create orders.


Order Processing Module:

Takes care of shopping cart management, order placement, and payment processing.
Interacts with the Product Catalog for product information and User Management for user details but is a distinct unit of its own.


Shipping Module:

Manages the logistics of shipping, tracking, and delivery updates.
Works with the Order Processing module but is separate enough to be developed and updated without interfering with other modules.
In a Modulith, these modules would be part of the same codebase and run in the same application runtime, but they would be developed and maintained somewhat independently. They would communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces or shared libraries, reducing the tight coupling often found in traditional monolithic applications. This setup allows teams to work on different parts of the application with less risk of stepping on each other's toes, making the development process more manageable and the application easier to understand and maintain.
