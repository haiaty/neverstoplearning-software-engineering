The Actor model defines a relatively simple but powerful way for designing and implementing applications that can distribute and share work across all system resourcesâ€”from threads and cores to clusters of servers and data centers. 
 
The Actor model is used to provide an effective way for building applications that perform tasks with a **high level of concurrency** and increasing levels of **resource efficiency**. Importantly, the Actor model also has well-defined ways for **handling errors and failures gracefully**, ensuring a level of **resilience** that isolates issues and prevents cascading failures and massive downtime
