# Tactics


Tactics are design decisions that influence the control of a quality attributes.


## Performance tactics

* Use Efficient Algorithms: The choice of algorithms can significantly impact the performance of a system. Always opt for efficient algorithms that can handle the required tasks with minimal resource usage.

* Effective Use of Caching: Caching can significantly improve the performance of a system by storing frequently accessed data in a manner that allows for faster retrieval.

* Load Balancing: Distribute the workload evenly across multiple system resources to prevent any single resource from becoming a bottleneck.

* Concurrency: Make use of concurrent processing wherever possible. This can be achieved through multi-threading or parallel processing.

* Resource Pooling: Instead of creating and destroying resources which can be expensive, maintain a pool of resources that can be reused.

* Data Compression: Compress data to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred or stored, thereby improving performance.

* Optimize Data Access: Minimize the amount of data that needs to be accessed to fulfill a request. This can be achieved by using techniques such as denormalization, indexing, and query optimization in databases.

* Use of Asynchronous Processing: Asynchronous processing allows a system to continue with other tasks without waiting for a response from a previous task.

* Performance Tuning: Regularly monitor and tune the performance of the system. This includes tuning the configuration of the system, the database, the network, etc.

* Scalability: Design your system to be scalable. This means that as the load increases, you can add more resources to handle the increased load without a significant decrease in performance.

* Use of CDN (Content Delivery Network): For web-based applications, a CDN can help to reduce latency and improve the speed of content delivery.

* Minimize Network Latency: Optimize the network and minimize the number of network calls to reduce latency.

- Manage sampling rate
- Limit event response
- Prioritize events
- Reduce overhead
- limit and boud execution times
- Increase resource efficiency
