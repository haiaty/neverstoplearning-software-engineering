# Functional Programming

Functional programming is not a framework or a tool, but a way of writing code; thinking functionally is radically different from thinking in object-oriented or imperative terms. 

In simple terms, FP is a software development style that places a major emphasis on the use of functions. In this regard, you might consider it a procedural programming paradigm (based on procedures, subroutines, or functions), and at its core it is, but with very different philosophies. You might say, “well, I already use functions on a day-to-day basis at work; what’s the difference?” As I mentioned earlier, functional programming requires you to think a bit differently about how to approach the tasks you are facing. Your goal will be to abstract entire control flows and operations on data with functions in order to avoid side effects and reduce mutation of state in your application. 

While based on very simple concepts, FP requires a shift in the way you think about a problem. This isn’t a new tool, a library, or an API, but a different approach to problem solving that will become intuitive once you’ve understood its basic principles, design patterns, and how they can be used against the most complex tasks. Also, it’s not an all or nothing solution. 

Thinking functionally involves treating parameters as not just simple scalar values but also as functions themselves that provide additional functionality; it also involves using functions or (callables) as just pieces of data that can be passed around anywhere. The end result is that we end up evaluating and combining lots of functions together that individually don’t add much value, but together solve entire programs.

Above all, is important the process of decomposing a program into smaller pieces that are more reusable, reliable, and easier to understand; then they are combined to form an entire program that is easier to reason about as a whole. Thinking about 
simple functions individually is very easy, and separating the concerns makes your programs easier to test. Every functional program follows this fundamental principle.
